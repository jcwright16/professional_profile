        <h2><a href="https://jcwright16.github.io/5e/">D&D 5e Custom Character Sheet</a></h2>
        <div class="paragraph-with-img">
            <img class="project-img" src="./5e_sheet.png" onclick="openPopup('./5e_sheet.png')">
            <p>
                This was my first larger-scale web development project. When starting a 5e
                D&D campaign with some friends, I found that I was frustrated with the 
                default character sheet for that edition. I wanted a way to include more information
                on my character in an organized way, and I wanted that information to be accessible
                from anywhere, and ideally, the tool would be usable for multiple players as well.
                <br><br>
                While the layout is largely complete, and there are several functional elements, the site
                is still a work in progress. I plan to add functionality to have separate players log in
                and save information that they've entered in the sheet.
            </p>
        </div>
        <b>Some Feature Highlights:</b>
        <div class="paragraph-with-img">
            <img class="text-img" src="./inventory.png" onclick="openPopup('./inventory.png')">
            <p>
                The Inventory sheet includes a table to track the number of coins of each type carried 
                by a player, and shows the conversion rates for coins of other types. For example, we 
                can see that 500 gold pieces are equivalent to 50,000 copper pieces, 5,000 silver pieces, 
                and so on. There is also a table to track information about items, and this table allows 
                a player to add and remove rows, and the total carry weight is tracked as well. The 
                Weapons table in the Combat sheet functions similarly to the Equipment table.

        <div class="paragraph-with-img">
            <img class="text-img" src="./spells.png" onclick="openPopup('./spells.png')">
            <p>
                The Magic sheet includes a searchable and sortable Spell table, allowing the player to 
                enter and quickly find information on their character's spells.

            <h2>Pokemon Elite Four Party</h2>
        </a>
        <div class="paragraph-with-img">

            <p>
                As I was playing through Pokemon FireRed, I wondered if could build a data-driven Pokemon
                party that was optimized to beat the Elite Four. I decided this was a perfect opportunity
                to practice with some Python web scraping and function building to score each Pokemon based
                on type advantage and total stats. Pokemon data has been one of my favorite varieties of
                data to practice with ever since I first started learning SQL and Python.
