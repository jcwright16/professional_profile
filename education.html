    <h1>Educational Background</h1>

    <p>
        I attended Wabash College from 2012 to 2016, having received the Honor Scholarship
        due to my high exam scores during Wabash's Honor Scholarship weekend. I graduated with
        a Bachelor of Arts in Psychology. My studies focused on cognitive, social, and developmental
        psychology research, with particular emphasis on human memory and theory of mind development.
        For my senior capstone project, I performed statistical analysis on data for a developmental
        psychology experiment which tested a novel methodology for measuring theory of mind development
        through a non-verbal task. I presented the findings of this analysis at the Mid-American 
        Undergraduate Research Conference.

        Following my graduation from Wabash, I took on graduate studies at Ball State University
        in the Teachers College and Miller College of Business. I received a Graduate Certificate
        in Business Essentials, having completed courses in financial accounting, business management,
        marketing, and supply chain operations. I also completed a Master of Science in Quantitative 
        Psychology. This was a program involving statistical research and machine learning techniques
        such as linear and logistic regression and classification algorithms. The coursework dealt
        with analyzing psychometric data using these techniques with the R programming language and 
        SPSS software.

        My academic background of working with data and statistics is what led me to work within
        the data consulting field. I joined Clarity Insights in February of 2019 through their Leadership 
        Development program, where I was trained as a Data Engineer while working to complete my
        Masters program at Ball State, which I did in December of 2019. Clarity was acquired by Accenture
        in 2020.
